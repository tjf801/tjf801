### Current Projects (ordered)[^1]:
 - [My Systems Programming class](https://github.com/tjf801/CSE-3100)[^2]
 - Actually making a functional personal website[^3]
 - A GPU-based simulation of Maxwell's equation using [Geometric Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_algebra#Classical_electromagnetism)
 - [Stockfish, but r/anarchychess](https://github.com/tjf801/AnarchoPleco)

[^1]: I usually work on these instead of listening to my CS lectures, so I'll probably have less progress on average during summer break
[^2]: If you're someone who goes to or works at UCONN, you don't see this repo. It doesn't exist. (BTW, your professor will know if you plagarize my code. It's very... unique.)
[^3]: [I am not a web developer.](https://tjf801.github.io/about)

### Past Projects:
 - [Yik Yak API](https://github.com/tjf801/old-yikyak-api)
 - [My Data Structures & Algorithms class](https://github.com/tjf801/CSE2050)[^2]
 - [Particle Collision Simulator](https://tjf801.github.io/projects/physics)[^4]
 - [Wordle Solver](https://github.com/tjf801/rust-wordle-solver)
 - [Small Minecraft Plugins](https://github.com/tjf801/KeepInventoryPlugin)
 - [C++ style printing in python](https://github.com/tjf801/Better-printing-in-python)

[^4]: This was originally a binary application that used [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML), and so the wasm version is WAY slower. I'll (probably) publish the original at some point

### I am Looking For:
 - A paid internship to get real-world experience

### Programming Languages:
 - C (intermediate)
   - I only really use C for small projects on embedded systems, or reading other people's C code.
 - Java (intermediate)
   - I have never consentually used Java, yet somehow I still have had to use it for YEARS.
 - Python (expert)
   - If you stranded me on a deserted island with nothing but a laptop, I could write a (mostly functional) clone of the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) interpreter.
 - Rust (intermediate)
   - I can use the language decently enough, but I certainly wouldn't call myself an expert by any means
