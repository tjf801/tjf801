I am Looking For:
 - A paid internship, to get real-world experience

Languages:
 - C (intermediate)
   - Just because I *can* write C, doesn't mean I like to any more than I have to.
   - (I only really use C for projects on embedded systems, or modifying other people's existing C code.)
 - Java (intermediate)
   - I have never consentually used Java. Yet I still have years of experience using it.
 - Python (expert)
   - If you locked me on a deserted island with nothing but a laptop, I could write a (mostly functional) clone of the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) interpreter.
 - Rust (intermediate)
   - I can use the language pretty well, and make projects with it quickly.
